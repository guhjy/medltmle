`medltmle`
================

## Description

`medltmle` estimates natural and stochastic mediation effect for a longitudinal setting with time-varying mediators. The package implements several estimators of the direct and indirect mediation effect over multiple time-points, adjusting for measured time-varying confounding and informative right-censoring. Currently available estimators include TMLE for longitudinal data, IPW, and longitudinal G-formula.
